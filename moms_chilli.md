| Amount           | Ingredient   |
| ---------------- | :----------- |
| 1 tablespoon     | arrowroot    |
| 1/3 cup          | paprika      |
| 1/2 tablespoon   | salt         |
| 1/4 tablespoon   | red pepper   |
| 1 1/3 tablespoon | cumin        |
| 1 1/2 tablespoon | onion flakes |
| 1 can (~16 oz)   | kidney beans |
| 2 lbs            | ground beef  |
| 8 oz             | tomato paste |

## 1. Make chili spice in a bowl

    1. 1/3 cup of Paprika (a little more better than a little less)
    2. 1/2 tablespoon salt
    3. 1/4 tablespoon red pepper (adjust to taste in the future)
    4. 1 1/3 tablespoon comino (cumin)
    5. 1 1/2 tablespoon onion flakes

no need to stir, but it easiest to put all of this in a bowl together

## 2. Open and drain 1 can kidney beans (~16 oz)

## 3. Sear 2 lbs ground beef

## 4. Add to beef

    1. 2 cups water (hot)
    2. 8 oz tomato sauce
    3. Spices
    4. One can kidney beans

alternatively use 2 cup water +~1 cup tomato paste, adding water first

## 5. Crank heat to high

## 6. Mix well

## 7. When mixture gets to a boil, turn down heat to a simmer

## 8. Simmer for 50 min while stirring occasionally so it doesn't get crusty. Add water as necessary to keep it bubbling

## 9. Mix 1 tablespoon arrowroot in 1/4 cup COLD water. This must be mixed completely

## 10. Add arrowroot mix to chili and stir in

## 11. Turn to a higher temp to boil of excess fluid and bring the mix to desired consistency WHILE stirring

## 12. Serve as desired

Cheese, onions, over pasta. Freezes very well. Just add a little water when reheating in the microwave

> Note: chili will be thicker after it cools for a little while, so it's often best to pull it off the heat before it's to desired consistency.
