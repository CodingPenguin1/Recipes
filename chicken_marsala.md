## 1. Liquids/Powders

Stir together Marsala, water, and cornstarch in a large bowl.

## 2. Mushrooms

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook mushrooms with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, stiring occasionally, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

## 3. Bacon

Cook bacon in same skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fat is rendered but bacon is not yet crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to bowl with mushrooms (reserve bacon fat in skillet).

## 4. Chicken

Stir together flour, garlic powder, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining teaspoon pepper in a shallow dish or bowl. Dredge chicken breasts in flour mixture, shaking off excess.

## 5. Cooking

Add remaining tablespoon butter to bacon fat in skillet and melt over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in 2 batches, turning over once, until no longer pink, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm.

## 6. Add Mushrooms

Stir cornstarch mixture and add to skillet. Bring sauce to a boil, whisking and scraping up browned bits. Add chicken and mushrooms and simmer until chicken is heated through, 2 to 4 minutes.
