## 1. Potatoes

Preheat oven to 400. In a large pot, combine the potatoes and salted water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and return the potatoes to the pot. Toss with 2 T butter, the parmesan, and parsley; season with salt and power. Cover to kep warm.

## 2. Chicken

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat 2 T EVOO over a medium-high heat. Season the chicken and cook, turning once, until golden-brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a baking dish; roast until cooked through, about 10 minutes.

## 3. Onions

In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 T each butter and EVOO over medium heat. Stir in the onions and vinegar and season with salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized, about 15 minutes. At the end, stir in 1/4 cup water and scrape up any browned bits.

## 4. Serve

Serve the chicken on a bed of spinach and top with the caramelized onions. Serve the potatoes on the side.
