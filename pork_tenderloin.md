## 1. Prep

Preheat oven to 400. In large, ovenproof skillet, heat 1 tbsp EVOO over medium-high heat. Season the prok with salt and pepper, add to the pan and cook, turning until browned all over, 5 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until cooked through, but still juicy, 10 to 13 minutes for 2 pieces, 30 for a whole tenderloin.

Let rest 5 minutes before slicing

## 2. Rice

While the pork is still roasting, prepare the rice according to package directions.

## 3. Vegetables

In a medium skillet, heat 1 tbsp EVOO over medium heat. Add half of the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the bell peppers and onion and cook until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tbsp lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.

## 4. Avocado

Scoop the avocado flesh into a small bowl. Mash in the parsley, 1 tbsp lemon juice, the remaining 1 tbsp EVOO, remaining garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.
